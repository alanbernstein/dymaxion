# a "map projection class" should be capable of accepting a set of parameters, a list of lat-lon shapes,
# and returning a corresponding list of shapes in the output/projected space.
# for conventional planar projections, this is a simpler concept, because the output space is simply a 2D plane.
# dymaxion projections for CNC introduce several complications:
# - "interruptions" can cause input shapes to result in multiple output shapes,
#   so the input is a list of shapes but the output is a list of lists of shapes.
#   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruption_(map_projection))
# - there are two output spaces:
#   - the surface of the polyhedron
#   - the 2d plane after unfolding the polyhedron
# - the unfolding step is itself nontrivial (see polyhedra.py)
# - any shape in the 2d plane that crosses a polyhedron face boundary
#   (even if not interrupted in the 2d layout after unfolding)
#   needs to be represented as a closed loop that coincides with that boundary.
#   this is the CNC requirement, and this is what necessitates this "partial-identity azimuthal"
#   intermediate "warp" projection.

"""
DymaxionProjection provides methods to compute a variety of dymaxion-like projections,
from the sphere to a polyhedron.

init methods:
  __init__ accepts a polyhedron, either by name, or by literally specified vertices, edges, and faces
    _init_from_name and _init_from_data handle the actual initialization of these
  _init_2d calculates and caches some values that are used to transform faces, and their corresponding projected shapes, to the final 2d layout

simple API methods:
  set_projection
  project

projection implementations:

  project_predistort_90
  project_predistort_45
  project_simple_closed - returns closed-loop shapes in the XY plane, in proper unrolled-polyhedron position+orientation. should be called once for each (face, shape) pair. "simple" indicates "no predistortion"
  project_simple_archimedean_face
  project_simple_archimedean
  project_simple_platonic

azimuthal_warp_projection - helper function for project_simple_closed
